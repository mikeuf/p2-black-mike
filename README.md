I used StackOverflow, Mozilla Developer Network, and W3Schools.

The biggest challenge was the accordion section. This is ironic since a fully-developed accordion was demonstrated during a lecture. I didn't realize the importance of the overflow:hidden attribute in creating the effect and got stuck for a long time trying to figure out the problem.
