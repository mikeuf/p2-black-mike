                  <p>Throughout history, Volusia County Public Libraries--which includes the Debary Public Library--were often started by women's clubs or associations which supported the library though memberships. They were often very small and located in small rooms in city halls or community centers. The collection consisted of second hand books donated from the citizens and there were not many professional librarians to run the facilities.</p> <p>Charlotte Smith, the head librarian at Stetson University, organized the Volusia County Public Library program in the year 1949 in an effort to upgrade libraries countywide. In the early 1950s in Florida, 200,000 people had no access to library services and only a quarter of the population had adequate service.</p>

                  <p>In the year 1956 Congress passed the Library Services Act which would provide funds to supplement or organize library service to communities under 10,000 population. These funds were provided for a period of two years in order to help set up a county system. This act started the wheels turning for two state officials, Elizabeth Cole, Florida State Public Library Consultant and Vera Nistendirk, Director of Extension Services. These two finally got the committee to recommend the formation of a unified county library system to the County Commissioners on April 12, 1961. By September 1961, the county library system went into operation and a library board member was appointed who then in turn hired the first Director of the Volusia County Public Library. All decisions were approved by the County Council.</p>

                  <p>By October 1, 1962 eight branches of the Volusia County Library System were in operation as well as the Library Headquarters and the Bookmobile Services. By October, 1980, all thirteen branches of the Volusia County Public Library had been established. Since then, with the help of Volusia County and the Friends of the Library group's, equipment, furnishings, and books have been purchased to keep up with the times and provide current information and exceptional service to the citizens of Volusia County.</p>
