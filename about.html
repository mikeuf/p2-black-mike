            <p>Throughout history, Volusia County Public Libraries--which includes the Debary Public Library--were often
              started by women's clubs or associations which supported the library though memberships. They were often
              very small and located in small rooms in city halls or community centers. The collection consisted of
              second hand books donated from the citizens and there were not many professional librarians to run the
              facilities.</p>

              <p>Charlotte Smith, the head librarian at Stetson University, organized the Volusia County Public Library
                  program in the year 1949 in an effort to upgrade libraries countywide. In the early 1950s in Florida,
                  200,000 people had no access to library services and only a quarter of the population had adequate
                  service.</p>

            <p>By October 1, 1962 eight branches of the Volusia County Library System were in operation as well as the
              Library Headquarters and the Bookmobile Services. By October, 1980, all thirteen branches of the Volusia
              County Public Library had been established. Since then, the Friends of the Library have helped us keep up with the times and
              provide current information and exceptional service to the citizens of Volusia County.</p>
